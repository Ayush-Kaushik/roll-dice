## 🏁 About <a name = "#getting_started"></a>  
I got the idea of this application while playing board games with my friends. I realized that we needed more than one dice  during our game but didn't have physical dice. Hence, I decided to create this easy to use application which will help you to have any number of dices just a click away.
